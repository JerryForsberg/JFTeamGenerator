# JFTeamGenerator

Purpose: 
  - The purpose of this app is to take user input regarding employee roles, and use it to create a webpage that displays the information for each employee. some of the information presented will be universal, and some will be role specific. 

Technologies used:
  - To  accomplish this task, I have used node.js and javascript, specifically using classes and subclasses and using testing to base the code off of. 
    
 Use: 
  - The user wil use the command line to start the app. 
  - They will be prompted with several questions regarding team member information and the roles of team members.
  - Based on the team members role, they will be asked to provide a specific piece of information. 
      - If the team member is a manager, they will be asked for their office number
      - If the team member is an engineer, they will be asked for their github name
      - If the team member is an intern, they will be asked which school they attend
  - Once information for one team member is completed, the app will ask the user if they would like to enter another team member.
      - If the user enters y, they will be prompted with the questions again.
      - If the user enters n, the function will end and an html file containing all the team member information will be created.
